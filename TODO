Higher priority
===============
Further management:
  Exchange / queue / binding arguments support (UI)
  Application list / start / stop
Fix backing queue status breakage
Fix management plugin shutdown
Add lots of uses of fine stats
Sorting by something not at top level (for message rates!)
Command-line / REPL client
Publish / get via HTTP
DTRT in a cluster
  One rabbit_event / rabbit_mgmt_db per cluster
  Per-node events to replace external_stats

Time series is a priority by itself
===================================
Cope with e.g. channel going away, want to view exchange / queue stats in the
  past
Aggregate connection / channel info over hosts
Garbage collection
Make rates into averages - configurable?
Add pretty graphs
Persist time series data over restarts?

Lower priority
==============
Further management:
  Reset / rotate logs / cluster
  VM stop
Write demo app.
Pagination / filtering (client-side? server-side?)
Client-side column hiding for e.g. message rates
Make user editing rather clearer
Allow empty fields in PUT
Activity log (to see things that flick in and out of existence quickly)

Less urgent / maybe
===================
Add more stats (bug 22996)
Write browser-level tests (from e.g. Selenium)
Alarms(?)
Sampling
Add more OS-y, Erlang-y things to overview(?)
Catch up if mgmt application is restarted
Queues with server generated names
Backup / restore entire state (with messages) (sane?)

When / if they become available in RabbitMQ
===========================================
e2e
Publisher acks
Queue browsing
