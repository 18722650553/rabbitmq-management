This is a normal RabbitMQ plugin. For detailed installation instructions
go to:
        http://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#installing-plugins

A summary:

    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella/
    cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
    make co
    make
    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-management/
    cd rabbitmq-management
    make

After that in the directory 'rabbitmq-public-umbrella/rabbitmq-management' you
should be able to see the plugins:
    $ ls dist
    amqp_client.ez  rabbit_common.ez     rabbitmq-management.ez  webmachine.ez
    mochiweb.ez     rabbitmq-management  rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez

To install them to a local RabbitMQ instance you need to copy *some* of the *.ez
files into your rabbit plugins directory and activate them. NB: do *not* copy
rabbit_common.ez!

For example:

    cp rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez mochiweb.ez webmachine.ez \
        amqp_client.ez rabbitmq-management.ez \
        /usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-2.0.0/plugins
    rabbitmq-activate-plugins
