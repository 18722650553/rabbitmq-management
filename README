This is a normal RabbitMQ plugin. For detailed installation instructions
go to:
        http://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#installing-plugins

A summary:

    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella/
    cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
    make co
    make
    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-management/
    cd rabbitmq-management
    make

After that in the directory 'rabbitmq-public-umbrella/rabbitmq-management' you
should be able to see plugins:

    $ ls  dist/
    amqp_client.ez  mochiweb.ez  rabbit_common.ez      rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez
    mochiweb.ez                  rabbit_management     webmachine.ez
    mochiweb-for-management.ez   rabbit_management.ez

To install them to a local RabbitMQ instance you need to copy some of *.ez
files into your rabbit plugins directory and activate them, for example:

    mkdir /usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-1.7.0/plugins
    cp rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez mochiweb-for-management.ez \
       webmachine.ez rabbit_management.ez \
        /usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-1.7.0/plugins
    rabbitmq-activate-plugins
