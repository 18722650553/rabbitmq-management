=============================
Backup / restore entire state (except messages).
Write more management:
  Purge queues
Do sensible things with vhosts in UI.
Fix refreshing.
Write more thorough unit tests, especially around listings.

Then
====
Write remaining management:
  Exchange / queue arguments support
  Bindings arguments support
  Application list / start / stop
  Reset / rotate logs / cluster
  VM stop
Figure out something sensible to do with time series.
  Cope with e.g. channel going away, want to view exchange / queue stats in the
  past.
  Garbage collection.
  Make rates into averages - configurable?
  Add pretty graphs.
  Persist time series data over restarts?
Fix backing queue status breakage.
Fix management plugin shutdown.
Refactor lots.
Add lots of uses of fine stats.
Improve L+F.
Write demo app.
Do something sensible with non-amqp channels.
Sorting / pagination / filtering (client-side? server-side?)
Client-side column hiding for e.g. message rates.
Command-line / REPL client.
Publish / get via HTTP, tie into simple messaging idea.
DTRT with direct connections.
Clustering management:
  One rabbit_event / rabbit_mgmt_db per cluster
  Per-node events to replace external_stats
Make user editing rather clearer
Allow empty fields in PUT.
Activity log (to see things that flick in and out of existence quickly).

Less urgent
===========
Add more stats (bug 22996).
Write browser-level tests (from e.g. Selenium).
Alarms(?).
Sampling.
Add more OS-y, Erlang-y things to overview(?)
Catch up if mgmt application is restarted.
Queues with server generated names
